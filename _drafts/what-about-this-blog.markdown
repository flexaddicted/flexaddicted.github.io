Yeah! This is my first post on Tumblr! I’m happy to announce this to you.
I opened this blog long time ago but I haven’t had enough time to write posts relative to programming. I’m not a “guru” but I like to learn new stuff. I like to keep myself always updated.
I work as a mobile developer in Milan and I would like to share tips and tricks I learn everyday.
So, what about this blog? This blog will be focused on Cocoa world, especially on iOS and Core Data. They are my big passion that I pursue also beyond my work activity. But these will not be the only arguments I will talk about. As a developer, stuff like JavaScript, HTML and mobile development in general will be presented.
So, stay tuned…stuff will coming soon!!
