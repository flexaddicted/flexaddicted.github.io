Hi there!

My name is Lorenzo and I’m very passionate about mobile development. Currently I work as an iOS Software Engineer at [Sky](https://corporate.sky.com).

I have more than five years of work experience with iOS. During my career I also worked with Xamarin, .NET Framework for Silverlight apps and JavaScript / HTML / CSS for Web and hybrid mobile apps. I like to keep up to date on new technologies and to experiment new stuff.

Sometimes I write this blog where I share thoughts and feelings about Cocoa programming.

I’m not only fond of Apple development but I have also different research interests. In fact, during my Ph.D., I focused my effort on Web Services, specification and verification of software systems, Business Process Management, Case Management, Adaptive Case Management, Business Processes Modeling, Intelligent User Interfaces, User Interfaces Integration and Healthcare systems.

You can find me also on <a href="https://twitter.com/flexaddicted">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/231684/lorenzo-b">Stack Overflow</a>.
